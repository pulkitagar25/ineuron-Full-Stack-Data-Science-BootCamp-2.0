    "Machine Learning is a form of artificial intelligence (AI) that teaches computers to think in a similar way to how humans do: Learning and improving upon past experiences. It works by exploring data and identifying patterns, and involves minimal human intervention.\n",

    "- Real-time chatbot agents.\n",
    "- Decision support.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Under the supervision of experts: Human-guided machine learning is a process whereby subject matter experts accelerate the learning process by teaching the technology in real-time. For example, if the machine learning model comes across a piece of data it is uncertain about, a human can be asked to weigh in and give feedback. The model then learns from this input, and uses it to make a more accurate prediction the next time. Human-guided machine learning works from the bottom up by first using algorithms to conduct the heavy lifting of identifying relationships within the data, and engaging humans when necessary for training or validation Concept Learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. With the assistance of experts in an indirect manner: Well The process of an algorithm learning from the training dataset can be thought of as a teacher supervising the learning process. We know the correct answers, the algorithm iteratively makes predictions on the training data and is corrected by the teacher. Learning stops when the algorithm achieves an acceptable level of performance Operant Conditioning.\n",

Self education: Ability to recognize patterns, learn from data, and become more intelligent over time (can be AI or programmatically based).Machine Learning: AI systems with ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed via training Hebbian Learning."

Ethics: The idea of trusting data and algorithms more than our own judgment has its pros and cons.Obviously, we benefit from these algorithms, otherwise, we wouldn’t be using them in the first place.

Sometimes, however, this means replacing someone’s job with an algorithm, which comes with ethical ramifications.\n",

It is a type of machine learning process, called deep learning, that uses interconnected nodes or neurons in a layered structure that resembles the human brain. It creates an adaptive system that computers use to learn from their mistakes and improve continuously. Thus, artificial neural networks attempt to solve complicated problems, like summarizing documents or recognizing faces, with greater accuracy.\n",
