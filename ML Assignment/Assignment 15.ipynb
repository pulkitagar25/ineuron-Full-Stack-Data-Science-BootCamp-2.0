    "- Supervised learning: In supervised learning, the model is trained on labeled data, meaning that the output or target variable is known. The model then makes predictions on new, unseen data based on the patterns learned from the labeled data. Examples of supervised learning include regression and classification problems.\n",
    "- Semi-supervised learning: In semi-supervised learning, the model is trained on a mixture of labeled and unlabeled data. The goal is to leverage the unlabeled data to improve the model's performance. Semi-supervised learning is useful when obtaining labeled data is expensive or time-consuming.\n",
    "- Unsupervised learning: In unsupervised learning, the model is trained on unlabeled data and is tasked with finding patterns or structures in the data. Unlike in supervised learning, the output variable is not known in advance. Examples of unsupervised learning include clustering and dimensionality reduction."

The k nearest neighbors are then selected based on the distance metric used (such as Euclidean distance).\n",

For a binary classification problem, the majority class among the k nearest neighbors is used as the predicted class label.

In regression problems, the average of the target values of the k nearest neighbors is used as the predicted value.\n",

    "A decision tree is a type of algorithm used for both regression and classification tasks in machine learning. It is a tree-based model where each internal node represents a \"test\" on an input feature, each branch represents the outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents a class label or a predicted value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the algorithm is to build a tree that accurately predicts the class label or numeric value of a target variable given the values of the input features. The decision tree is built by recursively splitting the training data into subsets based on the most \"significant\" feature that would split the data into the most \"pure\" subsets, where \"pure\" means that the subsets contain instances belonging to only one class or having similar target values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of splitting starts from the root node and continues until either a stopping criterion is met (such as a maximum tree depth, a minimum number of samples in a leaf, or no further improvement in the \"purity\" of the splits) or all the instances belong to the same class or have similar target values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The feature and the value used to split the data at a node are chosen based on an evaluation metric, such as information gain, gain ratio, or Gini impurity, which measure the improvement in the \"purity\" of the splits.\n",

    "Decision trees have several advantages, such as ease of interpretation, handling of both categorical and numerical features, and handling of missing values.

    "Inductive bias in decision trees refers to the set of assumptions and preferences made by the algorithm in choosing splits and constructing the tree structure. This bias influences the way the algorithm generalizes from the training data to make predictions on unseen data.\n",

    "To prevent overfitting in decision trees, several techniques can be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pruning: This involves removing some of the branches of the tree to reduce its size and complexity, making it less prone to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Ensemble methods: This involves combining multiple trees to make a prediction, such as Random Forest, which creates multiple decision trees and averages their predictions to make a final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Cost-complexity pruning: This involves adding a penalty term to the impurity measure used in the splits, such as the Gini impurity, that discourages the creation of overly complex trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Setting early stopping criteria: This involves setting a threshold for the maximum depth of the tree, the minimum number of samples required in a leaf node, or the maximum number of nodes in the tree, to avoid growing an overly complex tree.\n",
