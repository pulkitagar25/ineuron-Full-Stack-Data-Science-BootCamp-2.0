    "- Quantitative Data:- Quantitative Data, as the name suggests is one which deals with quantity or numbers. It refers to the data which computes the values and counts and can be expressed in numerical terms is called quantitative data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Qualitative Data:- Qualitative Data refers to the data that provides insights and understanding about a particular problem. It can be approximated but cannot be computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental points of difference between qualitative and quantitative data are discussed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The data type, in which the classification of objects is based on attributes (quality) is called qualitative data. The type of data which can be counted and expressed in numbers and values is called quantitative data.\n",
    "2. The research methodology is exploratory in qualitative data, i.e. to provide insights and understanding. On the other hand, quantitative data is conclusive in nature which aims at testing a specific hypothesis and examine the relationships.\n",
    "3. The approach to inquiry in the case of qualitative data is subjective and holistic whereas quantitative data has an objective and focused approach.\n",
    "4. When the data type is qualitative the analysis is non-statistical. As opposed to quantitative data which uses statistical analysis.\n",
    "5. In qualitative data, there is an unstructured gathering of data. As against this, data collection is structured in quantitative data."

Thus, for deciding the best method, it is important to identify issues and opportunities for collecting data according to the method. It might be helpful to engage in a pilot study to review our tools and sample size. \n",
    "2. Setting goals and objectives:  The researcher uses data to address his/her research questions and must design his/her methodology accordingly. Thus, every tool used by the researcher must have certain objectives which could be used for addressing these questions after analysis.\n",
    "3. Planning approach and methods: Researcher would make decisions pertaining to who will be surveyed, how data will be collected, sources and tools for data collection, and duration of the project.\n",
    "4. Collect data:  While planning the data collection, it is important to understand logistical challenges and prepare accordingly. "

    "The major issue that comes while using machine learning algorithms is the lack of quality as well as quantity of data. Although data plays a vital role in the processing of machine learning algorithms, many data scientists claim that inadequate data, noisy data, and unclean data are extremely exhausting the machine learning algorithms. \n",

    "## 6. How would the learning activity be affected if certain variables have missing values? Having said that, what can be done about it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans=>\n",
    "\n",
    "Even in a Well-Designed & Controlled study, Missing data occurs in almost all research. Missing data can reduce the statistical power of a study and can produce biased estimates, leading to invalid conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Real-world data collection has its own set of problems, It is often very messy which includes missing data, presence of outliers, unstructured manner, etc.\n",
    "2. Before looking for any insights from the data, we have to first perform preprocessing tasks which then only allow us to use that data for further observation and train our machine learning model.\n",
    "3. Missing value in a dataset is a very common phenomenon in the reality.\n",
    "4. Missing value correction is required to reduce bias and to produce powerful suitable models.\n",
    "5. Most of the algorithms can’t handle missing data, thus you need to act in some way to simply not let your code crash. So, let’s begin with the methods to solve the problem.\n",
    "6. Methods for dealing with missing values. The popular methods which are used by the machine learning community to handle the missing value for categorical variables in the dataset are as follows: Delete the observations: If there is a large number of observations in the dataset, where all the classes to be predicted are sufficiently represented in the training data, then try deleting the missing value observations, which would not bring significant change in your feed to your model."

    "## 8. What are the various data pre-processing techniques? Explain dimensionality reduction and function selection in a few words.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans=>\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Preprocessing can be done in four different ways. \n",
    "1. Data cleaning/cleaning:- Data cleaning methods aim to fill in missing values, smooth out noise while identifying outliers, and fix data discrepancies. Unclean data can confuse data and the model.\n",
    "- Handling the missing value\n",
    "- Noisy data\n",
    "2. Data integration :- It is involved in a data analysis task that combines data from multiple sources into a coherent data store. These sources may include multiple databases. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Data transformation :- This stage is used to convert the data into a format that can be used in the mining process. This is done in the following ways:\n",
    "-  Normalization:It is done to scale the data values in a specified range (-1.0 to 1.0 or 0.0 to 1.0)\n",
    "- Smoothing: Smoothing works to remove the noise from the data. Such techniques include binning, clustering, and regression.\n",
    "- Aggregation:Aggregation is the process of applying summary or aggregation operations on data.\n",
    "4. Data reduction :- Because data mining is a methodology for dealing with large amounts of data. When dealing with large amounts of data, analysis becomes more difficult. We employ a data reduction technique to get rid of this. Its goal is to improve storage efficiency while lowering data storage and analysis expenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dimensionality Reduction :A huge number of features may be found in most real-world datasets. Consider an image processing problem: there could be hundreds of features, also known as dimensions, to deal with. As the name suggests, dimensionality reduction seeks to minimize the number of features — but not just by selecting a sample of features from the feature set, which is something else entirely — Feature Subset Selection or feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Function Selection:- It is the process of automatically choosing relevant features for your machine learning model based on the type of problem you are trying to solve. We do this by including or excluding important features without changing them. It helps in cutting down the noise in our data and reducing the size of our input data."

    "The interquartile range is a measure of where the “middle fifty” is in a data set. Where a range is a measure of where the beginning and end are in a set, an interquartile range is a measure of where the bulk of the values lie. That’s why it’s preferred over many other measures of spread when reporting things like school performance or SAT scores.\n",
