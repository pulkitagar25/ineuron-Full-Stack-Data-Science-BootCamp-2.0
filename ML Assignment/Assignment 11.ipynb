    "1. X and Y are the outcomes of rolling two equal and fair dice, so each value of X and Y can be any integer between 1 and 6. The range of X and Y is therefore RX = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} and RY = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. The PMF (Probability Mass Function) of X and Y can be found by counting the number of ways each value of X and Y can occur and dividing by the total number of possible outcomes. Since each die has 6 sides, there are 6 * 6 = 36 possible outcomes. For example, the probability of X = 2 and Y = 6 can be found as follows: P(X = 2, Y = 6) = 1/36. By counting the number of outcomes for each value of X and Y and dividing by 36, we can find the PMFs of X and Y.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. P(X = 2, Y = 6) is the probability that both dice show 2 and 6 respectively. Since each die has 6 sides and is fair, the probability of each side showing up is 1/6. The probability of X = 2 and Y = 6 is therefore P(X = 2, Y = 6) = 1/6 * 1/6 = 1/36.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. P(X > 3 | Y = 2) is the probability that X is greater than 3, given that Y is 2. To find this, we need to count the number of outcomes where Y = 2 and X > 3, and divide by the total number of outcomes where Y = 2. There are 2 outcomes where Y = 2 (X can be 4 or 5), and 2 of these outcomes have X > 3. Therefore, P(X > 3 | Y = 2) = 2/2 = 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. If Z = X + Y, then the range of Z is the set of all possible sums of values in RX and RY. Since each value of X and Y can be between 1 and 6, the minimum possible value of Z is 2 (when X = 1 and Y = 1), and the maximum possible value of Z is 12 (when X = 6 and Y = 6). The range of Z is therefore RZ = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12}. The PMF of Z can be found by counting the number of ways each value of Z can be obtained as the sum of X and Y, and dividing by the total number of possible outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. P(X = 4 | Z = 8) is the probability that X is 4, given that Z is 8. To find this, we need to count the number of outcomes where Z = 8 and X = 4, and divide by the total number of outcomes where Z = 8. There are 4 outcomes where Z = 8 (X can be 2, 3, 4, or 5, and Y can be 6 - X), and 1 of these outcomes has X = 4. Therefore, P(X = 4 | Z = 8) = 1/4 = 0.25."
