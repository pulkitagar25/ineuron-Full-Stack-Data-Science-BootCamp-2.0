    "In Bayesian probability, the probability of an event is defined as a measure of one's belief or degree of certainty in the occurrence of the event, which is updated as more evidence is obtained. This interpretation views probabilities as subjective, personal, and constantly updated based on new information, and allows for incorporating prior beliefs and knowledge into probability calculations."
