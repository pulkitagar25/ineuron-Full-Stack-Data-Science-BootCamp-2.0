    "An artificial neuron, also known as a perceptron, is a mathematical function that models the behavior of a biological neuron. Like a biological neuron, an artificial neuron has inputs, processes them, and produces an output. The main components of an artificial neuron are:\n",
    "- Inputs: Artificial neurons receive one or more input values, each of which is a numeric value.\n",
    "- Weights: Each input is multiplied by a weight, which determines the strength of the input's influence on the output of the neuron.\n",
    "- Summation function: The weighted inputs are summed together, and an additional bias value is added to the sum. This forms the weighted sum of the inputs, which is the total input to the neuron.\n",
    "- Activation function: The weighted sum of the inputs is passed through an activation function, which produces the output of the neuron. The activation function introduces nonlinearity into the neuron, allowing it to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of an artificial neuron is similar to a biological neuron in that it receives input, processes it, and produces an output. However, the way that an artificial neuron works is much simpler and more abstract than a biological neuron."
