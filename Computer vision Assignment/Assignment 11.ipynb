    "## 1. What do REGION PROPOSALS entail?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans=>\n",
    "\n",
    "Region Proposals refer to a technique used in object detection, where the goal is to identify and localize the objects of interest in an image. Region proposals involve generating a set of potential object locations or regions in the image and then using these proposals to guide the object detection process. The idea behind region proposals is to reduce the search space for object detection, making the process more efficient and faster. Common methods for generating region proposals include selective search, sliding windows, and R-CNNs."

    "\n",
    "Ans=>\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-maximum Suppression (NMS) is a post-processing technique used in object detection to eliminate overlapping bounding boxes that correspond to the same object in the image. NMS works by keeping the bounding box with the highest confidence score and removing all other overlapping boxes with lower scores. The goal of NMS is to ensure that each object in the image is represented by a single bounding box, even if multiple boxes were generated for the same object due to overlapping or ambiguity in the object's shape."

    "Ans=>\n",
    "\n",
    "mAP stands for Mean Average Precision, and it is a metric used to evaluate the performance of object detection algorithms. The mAP metric calculates the average precision of the algorithm across all objects in the dataset, taking into account both the precision and recall of the algorithm. Precision measures the fraction of correctly detected objects among all objects detected by the algorithm, while recall measures the fraction of correctly detected objects among all objects present in the dataset. The mAP metric provides a single score that summarizes the overall accuracy of an object detection algorithm."

    "Frames per Second (FPS) is a measure of the number of individual frames or images that are processed in a video or image sequence in one second. FPS is commonly used to evaluate the performance of computer vision algorithms and to compare the processing speed of different systems. A higher FPS value indicates that the algorithm is able to process more images in a shorter amount of time, making the system more efficient and faster."

    "\n",
    "Intersection Over Union (IOU) is a metric used to evaluate the accuracy of object detection algorithms. IOU measures the overlap between the ground truth bounding box for an object and the predicted bounding box generated by the algorithm. The IOU metric is calculated as the ratio of the area of overlap between the two bounding boxes to the area of the union of the two bounding boxes. A high IOU value indicates that the predicted bounding box is accurate and well-aligned with the ground truth bounding box, while a low IOU value indicates that there is a significant misalignment between the two boxes."

    "\n",
    "Precision-Recall Curve (PR Curve) is a graphical representation of the precision and recall of a machine learning model, typically used to evaluate object detection algorithms. The x-axis of the PR curve represents recall, while the y-axis represents precision. The curve is generated by varying the threshold used to classify an object detection as positive or negative, and plotting the precision and recall values for each threshold. The PR curve provides a visual representation of the trade-off between precision and recall, and can be used to determine the optimal threshold for a given object detection task."

    "Ans=>\n",
    "\n",
    "Selective Search is a technique for generating region proposals for object detection in images. The selective search algorithm works by first creating a hierarchical segmentation of the image, and then merging similar segments based on color, texture, and other features. The resulting segments are then used as potential object locations, or region proposals, for the object detection algorithm. Selective search is a fast and effective way to generate region proposals, and has been widely used in object detection algorithms such as R-CNNs."

    "- Slow inference speed: The slow inference speed of R-CNNs makes them less suitable for real-time object detection applications.\n",
    "- Limited scalability: R-CNNs are not easily scalable to large datasets or to real-world object detection problems with many classes and object variations.\n",
